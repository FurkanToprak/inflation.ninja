        How to beat inflation like a ninja:
    </h6>
    <div>1) Limit your spending.</div>
    <div>2) Invest in companies that have <u>pricing power</u>, <u>low capital investment needs</u>, and have
        <u>historically outperformed inflation</u>.</div>
    <div>3) Invest in your skills. The value of your cash will decrease, but the value of your skills will not.</div>
    <div>4) Do not invest in bonds and hold as little cash as possible.</div>
    <div>5) Invest in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. These securities pay interest twice a year that matches
        the increase in the Consumer Price Index.</div>
